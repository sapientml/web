## Overview{.lined #h2-1}

SapientML is an AutoML technology that can learn from a corpus of existing datasets and their human-written pipelines, and efficiently generate a high-quality pipeline for a predictive task on a new dataset.

## Features{.lined #h2-2}

- High speed: It can generate an AI model quickly by evaluating not all the combinations of the machine learning pipelines but only the most plausible machine learning pipelines.
- Transparency: It is easy to understand how the AI model is build by checking the generated machine learning program containing the explanation.
- High Accuracy: It can generate highly accurate AI models by the prediction based on the past knowledge of the programs that were used to build highly accurate AI models.
